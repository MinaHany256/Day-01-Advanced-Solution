            //int[] numbers = { 8,6,2,4 };

            //Helper<int>.Sort(numbers);

            //foreach (int i in numbers)

            #region 2. create a generic Range<T> class that represents a range of values from a minimum value to a maximum value. The range should support basic operations such as checking if a value is within the range and determining the length of the range.

            //Range<int> range = new Range<int>(10, 20);

            //int value = 5;
            //bool result = range.IsInRange(value);
            //int length = range.Length();
